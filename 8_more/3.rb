What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling enables a program to still run in the event of an error (or exception) because the exception has been handled, or isolated, contained, and rescued. 
It solves the problem of a whole program breaking from one error. 

It changes the flow of control of the program without exiting the program completely.
