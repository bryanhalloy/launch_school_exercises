Input: a year, a month, a day of the week, and a descriptor
Return value: An exact date (year, month day)
Output: nothing

Requirements:
TA - construct objects that represent a meetup date.
TA - Your object should be able to determine the exact date of the meeting in the specified month and year
TA - The descriptors that may be given are strings: 'first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'last', and 'teenth'.
TA - The case of the strings is not important;
TA - That is, every month has exactly one "teenth" Monday, one "teenth" Tuesday, etc. 
TA - The fifth day of the month may not happen every month, but some meetup groups like that irregularity.
TA - The days of the week are given by the strings 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', and 'Sunday'
TA - a fifth day, if not available, should return nil
TA - needs to work for leap years


E
if you ask for the 2nd Wednesday of May 2021, the object should be able to determine that the meetup for that month will occur on the 12th of May, 2021.


D
class Meetup(year, month)
Meetup#day(day string, descriptor) -> date object






A
General gist is that i will start with the first of the given month, and keep adding days and keep testing each day if it meets the given criteria


require date

initialize
  first_of_month_date = set new date object to first of given month year
  set naive date to nil
  set descriptor and dow to nil


day (weekday, descriptior)
  set new instance vars and downcase them
  loop
    return date if dow mathes && decriptor matches
    return nil if date does not exist
    else next day
  reset instance vars
  return date
  end

  dow_matches
    date to dow = hash lookup weekday
  end

  descriptor_matches
    set counter to zero
      start with first day and add one to counter if 
        if first/last type, 
        dow matches
        more work needed

      need extra logic for teenth
    return true/false

  get_dow_target
    hash lookup
  
  is_first
  
  is_second

  is_third

  is_fourth

  is_fifth

  is_teenth
