Write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.

An isosceles triangle has exactly two sides of the same length.

A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

Note: For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides must be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

P
== Need a method or test that returns triangle type

Implied:
== can take floats
== negative sides raises argument error
== 0 len sides raises argument error

E
test for illegal triangles (lengths)
== test for string input
== test for too many arguments
== test for nil sides
== test to ensure sides are numbers





D
Define class triangle
define lots of private methods with tests that raise various errors and checks
