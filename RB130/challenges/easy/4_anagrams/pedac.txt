P
Write a program that takes a word and a list of possible anagrams and selects the correct sublist that contains the anagrams of the word.

inputs - a string (multi case), and an array of strings
return value - an array of strings (valid anagrams)
output - nothing

explicit requirements:



implicit requirements:
/return empty array if no matches
/identical word is not an anagram
/a subset is not an anagram


assumed requirements:
Assume no punctiation or spaces. No validation input. 
/a one-letter word cannot have anagrams because self cant be anagram
/an empty input word has no anagrams
/case insensitive
== no punctuation
== no spaces on input
/multi words in list are outputted just once



E
For example, given the word "listen" and a list of candidates like "enlists", "google", "inlets", and "banana", the program should return a list containing "inlets". Please read the test suite for the exact rules of anagrams.



D
Anagram class
Anagram#match(input_array)


A
remove duplicates in test array
convert target word to downcase array and sort
iterate (select) through each test_word in input array
  downcase test word
  if unsorted target word = test word, break and set false
  
  assume true
  convert test word to array and sort
  iterate through each index in test_word
    if test at index = target at index next
    if not, break and set flag to false
done
