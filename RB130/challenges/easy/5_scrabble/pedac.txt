=/ Whitespace scores zero
=/ Nil scores zero
=/ case insensitive

=/ also need a class method

3 points for B (there are two)

D
Scrabble(word) 
Scrabble#score
store scores in a hash, where score is key and letters are value array
score storage variable

A
downcase word
initialzie score aggregator
iterate each char reduce
  get_letter_score(letter) and aggregate
