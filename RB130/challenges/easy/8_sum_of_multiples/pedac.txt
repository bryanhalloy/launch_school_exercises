Write a program that, given a natural number and a set of one or more other numbers, can find the sum of all the multiples of the numbers in the set that are less than the first number. If the set of numbers is not given, use a default set of 3 and 5.

Input: natural number and array of other numbers
Return: integer
Output: nothing

Requirements:
=/ If the set of numbers is not given, use a default set of 3 and 5
=/ The divisor set is stored in a SumOfMultiples object
=/ Return 0 if no multiples fit
=/ Remember, multiples less than (no equal to) the input number
=/ Sum of unique mulitples (filter out duplicates)

Ignoring:
Iput validation -  
  Input must be a natural number
  Divors must be natural numbers

Instantiate class object
  assume [3,5] if empty
  make reader method

instance method to
  multiples array set to zero
  for each number in input array
    1 up to input number
      test if iter % divisor == 0
      if yes, shovel into factors array
  factors.uniq.sum
