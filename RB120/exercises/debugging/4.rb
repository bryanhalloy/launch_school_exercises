# Example

miller_contracting = EmployeeManagementSystem.new('Miller Contracting')

becca = Employee.new('Becca', '232-4437-1932')
raul = Employee.new('Raul', '399-1007-4242')
natasha = Employee.new('Natasha', '399-1007-4242')

miller_contracting << becca     # => Employee added.
miller_contracting << raul      # => Employee added.
miller_contracting << raul      # => Employee serial number is already in the system.
miller_contracting << natasha   # => Employee serial number is already in the system.
miller_contracting.remove(raul) # => Employee deleted.
miller_contracting.add(natasha) # => Employee added.

miller_contracting.display_all_employees


=begin
Traceback of the issue starts on line 82, where the  miller_contracting objectect invokes the << method to try to add the raul employee object to its employees instance object. To summarize, the custom-defined << method which is aliased to the method named `add` defined on line 9) uses a custom `==` operator to check if a given employee object is already in the  employees instance object (an array). This Employee#== method calls the reader `serial number` method on BOTH itself and the employee object passed to it as an arguemnt. The issue is in the latter; the reader serial_number method is private and can only be invoked upon itslef (the calling instance, which in in this case is the becca employee object that e in line 30 points to. To fix this we can make the method protected, which will still limit its invocation to inside the class definition but can be invoked on itself AND other objects of the same class.
