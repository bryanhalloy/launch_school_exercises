# In #1, the method will be mutating the buffer argument (I assume an array). The second one will not, but will return a new buffer array. The right one depends on how the method is used in the broader program. 

# Yes, the first method both mutates and argument and returns a meaningful value, which is not optimal. So method 2 is probably better.
