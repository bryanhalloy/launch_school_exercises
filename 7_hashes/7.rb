NoMethodError: undefined method `keys' for Array
A. We're missing keys in an array variable.

B. There is no method called keys for Array objects.

C. keys is an Array object, but it hasn't been defined yet.

D. There's an array of strings, and we're trying to get the string keys out of the array, but it doesn't exist.

Answer is B. This error would appear if you try to use the keys method on an array. There is no standard keys method for arrays, since arrays dont have keys.
